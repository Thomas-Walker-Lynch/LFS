  Robert discussed setting up the emulator and use of ssh

2022-02-24 work session
  set up an emulator first time in years, screwed up the disk while going through LFS book starting again

  isntalled emulated debian11, got ssh running

  started on book - Linux from Scratch version 11.0  2021-09-01

  installed LFS required packages, most already on the system by default
  g++ was not listed as required by the check script complained it was missing
  Xz is in xzutils (fedora at least)
  
  running the here-doc check script book page 14-15

  creating a new partition

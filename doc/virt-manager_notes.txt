  ----------------------------------------
  creating a new machine
    because I screwed up the other one by removing package dependecies when removing python3 before
    reinstalling it .., which deleted all sorts of stuff including apparently xfce4.

  running virt-manager electing to create a new machine off the menus

  machine name: debian11-2
  network: bridge virbr0

  Used browse option to select the install image from local lib.

  Used the browse option to select already created disk located in lib.
    Had one already, otherwise would have created a new one.  Should
    go find where virt-manager stores those by default, and delete any
    existing ones.

  mem: 4096
  secondary storage: 30G
  cores: 12
     Wonder if it is a bad idea to let is loose on all the cores on
     the machine.  Funny, noticed in /proc/cpuinfo that only 11 cores
     are listed ...

  ----------------------------------------
  Now installing Debian

    graphical install 
    hostname: debian11-2 (same as the machine name)
    user: thomas
    use entire disk, all files in single volume
    no proxy info
    window manager: xfce4 - perhaps save a little space
    
    ok finally it is install grub
    it makes me click on and select /dev/sda1

    ok, completed, what happens when I hit continue?
    machine is booting, I have a grub boot menu, timed out while typing this booting debian
    ok have a login window
    logging in for the heck of it (i really just want to ssh in) yep, there is my desktop

  ----------------------------------------
  ssh into the emulator

   > ip addr 

    both my local network and virbr0 are 192.x.x.x/24 and they overlap. I wish they
    were /8 don't know how routing will work, but I am using the full address of the
    device so it will be ok.

   > ssh thomas@192.168.122.1
        ssh: connect to host 192.168.122.1 port 22: Connection refused

   installing sshd on debian11-2:
   https://techviewleo.com/install-configure-ssh-server-on-debian/

   $ su -l
   # apt update   <- strange all packages up to date from the install cdrom
   # apt upgrade
   # apt install openssh-server
   # systemctl enable ssh
   # systemctl start ssh
   # ip a
       -> 192.168.122.77

   Oh gosh, had the wrong address, now I don't know if I really needed to
   install sshd

   > ssh thomas@192.168.122.77

   yes I get a prompt and log in

   ok back to emacs and back to the LFS book starting over ...
   Find file: /ssh:thomas@192.168.122.77/~
   <alt-x> shell
   etc.

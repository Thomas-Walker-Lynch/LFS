    are you ready for the Linux From Scratch meeting on Thursday? Do you have memory and disk for the emulator? I know Robert and Peter are looking forward to it. R

    I feel better, I'm quite tired at the moment. I have the memory for the disk and the emulator.

    to Robert, Peter, geist1122, Dimitris
    Robert's command ended up being:

    cores=  number of cpu cores
    lib/disk = the drive the emulator will use
    eth0= device for the network,  I it was originally net0 or something
    mem= 4G the memory of course

    qemu-kvm -cpu max -smp $cores -enable-kvm -hda "$lib"/"$disk" -cdrom "$lib"/"$isntall_image" -device e1000.netdev="$eth0" -netdev user.id=net0.hostfwd=tcp::5555-:22 -m "$mem" -boot d

    I gather that cores and mem can be changed after the initial setup?

    I had errors on the networking, and as I have Fedora I had to look up some other documentation.  I still could not get the command line to go even following what the doc had, so I ended up using libvert.   With libvert I get a vert-manager with a gui for creating virtual machines. 

    I have created a git repository for our group.   www.github.com/thomas-walker-lynch/LFS  Hopefully people can record some commands/scripts in there.  I started it.

    to Peter
    typos -- thankyou!

    great - I put it in the doc directory

    Surprisingly productive meeting yesterday.  Really looks like we are going to get LFS together.

    I tried to get qemu on my windows, but it wouldn't work, but I do have Debian 11.2 on my Dell 390 installed.. Thank You Marty

    Marty11:28 AM
    Much better
    Marty11:31 AM
    Thomas,  On Debian "How" do You access root ? Thank You Marty
    Thomas Walker Lynch11:33 AM
    su -l
    is my usual method
    that is the letter el
    > su -l 
    then it gives me a shell
    Marty11:34 AM
    Under terminal, I can access marty@debian:/home/marty  -- but, not by root Thank You Marty
    Thomas Walker Lynch11:35 AM
    yeah, it did not let me ssh into the emulated machine as root either.  So I logged in as thomas.   Then at the bash shell prompt I used su -l  to become root.
    How far have you gotten Marty .. I think the rest of us have not even partitioned a drive for LFS yet
    Marty11:38 AM
    Hi; I have typed su-l and it says  -- command not found
    Thomas Walker Lynch11:39 AM
    I am not sharing right now, but I thought we solved that.   You might have been looking at Dimitris's share.
    excuse me, ... that was the wrong point in the chat

    su   and -l  are separate
    -l is an option

        Hi Thomas;

        Here is the video Link :

        CHARITY STREAM: Building Linux (and Firefox) From Scratch (Part 1) - YouTube

        I can't get it to copy and paste the actual link while watching it, I will try something else..

        NCommander - YouTube

        It won't copy and paste the actual links, but hopefully if You go to Youtube and copy one of these in, it will get You closer or there..

        THANK YOU Marty

        Hi Thomas;

        I have over 20 + hours into LFS 11.1 and trying to set up vi, I did something wrong and couldn't get out of it, and Had to close the Terminal.. I could NOT get back into chroot, properly..
        It looks like In the morning, I will need to re-install Linux Mint and start ALL over on LFS 11.1..

        THANK YOU Marty

    [I also have about 20 hours into it at this point, that being only 4 or 5 half days -Thomas]

    ** had to sudo the make install for binutils

    ** configure gcc failed due to lack of C++,  apt install g++
     configure still configure: error: Building GCC requires GMP 4.2+, MPFR 3.1.0+ and MPC 0.8.0+.

     mpfr says it needs gmp so:
     making gmp using same proceedure.  make install again gets errors running it with sudo

I am using github.com/Thomas-Walker-Lynch/resources.  This includes the directory names 'executable library source document' instead
of 'bin lib src docs'  for the LFS build scripts repo - not for LFS!

Divergences from the book:

  1. The initial user created with the Debian install (on the QEMU virtual machine)
  is already lfs.  We don't start out as root in the book.  Hence we do not need to add the lfs user and
  fix permissions in s4.3.  I am wondering if we will need a grand fix permissions at some point.

Scripts are in flux .. see notes in the scripts

still neeed to apply patches s3.3

s7.07_libstdc++
  #the book has this, but gthr-posix.h is inside libgcc
  #ln -s gthr-posix.h libgcc/gthr-default.h
  ln -s libgcc/gthr-posix.h libgcc/gthr-default.h
  ...
    #this has to be done with sudo because the build process runs as root and it modifies the source tree
    sudo rm -rf source/$SOURCE_DIR

book does not conform to RFC2119

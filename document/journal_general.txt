  first meeting

2022-02-24 meeting

   Pretty much everyone is stuck at some point before the disk partitioning.  Lots of ssh issues.  Robert showed
   for a short time, he is on chapter 10, and his ssh works.

    Robert didn't make the meeting.  Turns out he doesn't see it on the Google calendar and didn't have a link (ouch).  Well
    email one next time.

    Dimitris, Peter, and I are just at the point the emulator is working, can scp stuff, and have downloaded the sources.
    Marty appears to be nearly finished.

    Peter pointed out that a couple of the sources do not have md5 sums.  dbus is one of them - a very important package
    from a security perspective.

    Dimitris has written that he has a class paper due tomorrow and will not make the meeting.

  first meeting

2022-02-24 meeting (2)

   Pretty much everyone is stuck at some point before the disk partitioning.  Lots of ssh issues.  Robert showed
   for a short time, he is on chapter 10, and his ssh works.

    Robert didn't make the meeting.  Turns out he doesn't see it on the Google calendar and didn't have a link (ouch).  Well
    email one next time.

    Dimitris, Peter, and I are just at the point the emulator is working, can scp stuff, and have downloaded the sources.
    Marty appears to be nearly finished.

    Peter pointed out that a couple of the sources do not have md5 sums.  dbus is one of them - a very important package
    from a security perspective.

    It seems that setting up QEMU has been the hardest step.  D & I used Fedora 35 virtualizaiton tag.  This was simple,
    but brings little understanding of what is under the hood.  Robert has a firm grasp of it and made a video, but those
    commands did not quite work for us, perhaps due to differences in the distros the emulator is being run on.  libvert did
    not quite work for D on Debian 11, so he changed to F35 as a host machine. Peter is working on a Windows host, and ran
    into support and deprecation issues for his eventual target machine, but those have worked out (?).   Not sure
    what Marty is using.

    We are using two different approaches for ssh to the virtual machine.   Robert has ssh reachable on the host machine
    but a non-standard port for sshd.   D and I are using bridge device, virtbr0 and the IP that shows on the virtual
    machine using ‘ip a’.

    ‘ssh’ and ‘scpy’ turn out to be valuable tools.  Both Robert and I are just opening Tramp shells in emacs to work
    on the virtual machine.

    Dimitris has written saying he has a class paper due tomorrow and will not make the meeting.

    I think we need to do something about the missing md5s, and the check script not mentioning
    missing sums.  This is a security hole.

    Robert finished and uploaded his logs to the github.

    I guess that Marty has finished, or is very close.

    Peter and I are still trying to get the sources to compile.  We sepnt some time with scp, so
    the emulation part continues to be a large part of the effort.

     So far only Marty and I today.   Marty is installing to real hardware.  The rest of us used
     an emulator.

        Hi Thomas;

        I have over 20 + hours into LFS 11.1 and trying to set up vi, I did something wrong and couldn't get out of it, and Had to close the Terminal.. I could NOT get back into chroot, properly..
        It looks like In the morning, I will need to re-install Linux Mint and start ALL over on LFS 11.1..

        THANK YOU Marty

    [I also have about 20 hours into it at this point, that being only 4 or 5 half days -Thomas]

    ** had to sudo the make install for binutils

    ** configure gcc failed due to lack of C++,  apt install g++
     configure still configure: error: Building GCC requires GMP 4.2+, MPFR 3.1.0+ and MPC 0.8.0+.

     mpfr says it needs gmp so:
     making gmp using same proceedure.  make install again gets errors running it with sudo

2022-02-24
  set up an emulator first time in years, screwed up the disk while going through LFS book starting again

  isntalled emulated debian11, got ssh running

  started on book - Linux from Scratch version 11.0  2021-09-01

  installed LFS required packages, most already on the system by default
  g++ was not listed as required by the check script complained it was missing
  Xz is in xzutils (fedora at least)
  
  running the here-doc check script book page 14-15

  creating a new partition

2022-03-03
  meeting in a few hours, better make some progress ...

  running virt-manager doing a new install with a 40G disk, 20G for each of mnt-LFS and Debian

  create a virtual machine -> error no connections ah, same D got, what did we do ..
  https://askubuntu.com/questions/932200/kvm-virt-manager-error-no-active-connection-to-installed-on
  sudo usermod -a -G libvirt Thomas-repos
  ^ this fixed the problem
  lib-vert
  new machine
  had to browse to find image
  it complains that it "might" not have search path, I ignored this
  4G memory 12 processors (used all cores available, someday there will be thousands of them eh?)
  network virbr0 it already exists
  I get the install window for debian
  graphical install
  it is running
  machine name: lfs0  domain: reasoningtechnology.com

  partitioning disks
    nope need manual -> guided entire disk (no LVM, no encryption)
      virtual disk a shows as 42.9 GB, though I had speced 40GB
      all files on partition
      oops no options for creating /mnt-LFS .. going back

    "partioning disks"
    undo changes
    unobvious has a ">"  device name shows  "FREE SPACE", __clicked on that__ and get a menu to create a partition

    made it "14 GB"  then done setting up partition,
    label: 2022-03-03 Debian 11
    don't forget to set boot flag to true, also careful as the partioner flips this off every chance it gets
    (wonder if we still need to do that, does grub check it?)

    clicking on "FREE SPACE" again
    8 GB
    "Beginning"   beginning of free space, not beginning of disk
    use as, clicked, swap area

    clicking on "FREE SPACE" again
    mount point - /mnt/LFS
    label: 2022-03-03 LFS 11.1 build

    write changes
    journal_thomas.txt:  Xz is in xzutils (fedora at least)

    people have their LFS mounts a little off. The 

    it looks they are expecting $LFS to be owned by root, buy mine is owned by thomas .. hmmm by these directions
    they mounted the LFS partition on /mnt/LFS/home   so /mnt/LFS/sources will end up on the host drive rather
    than on the LFS drive, ah well, mine will end up on the LFS drive because I mounted it at /mnt/LFS (not /mnt/LFS/home)

    ** foo -- sources list and packages list are the same  I downloaded both the wget list and the tar files

    oh gosh, seems we are missing the meeting chat 
    
    alright getting started:
      ch_repo LFS  and off we go

    1. start the emulator
     > virt-manager  
       - then the triangle ‘play’ button to run the deb 11 machine, it shows a load usage graph. 
    
    2. emacs ssh
       - haven't setup keys yet, so I will need the passwords.
       - trick is to visit the home directory on the machine using tramp, then to launch a shell from there.
         Apparently that is how people are doing it from the M-x line.  Think I will setup a function
         to just shell in directly.
       - the debian machine is not letting me ssh in as root, so I have to go to thomas, then su -l
        to get a root shell

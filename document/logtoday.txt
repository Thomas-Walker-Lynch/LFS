Thomas, Your print is way too small


ip a


Marty11:28 AM
Much better
Marty11:31 AM
Thomas,  On Debian "How" do You access root ? Thank You Marty
Thomas Walker Lynch11:33 AM
su -l
is my usual method
that is the letter el
> su -l 
then it gives me a shell
Marty11:34 AM
Under terminal, I can access marty@debian:/home/marty  -- but, not by root Thank You Marty
Thomas Walker Lynch11:35 AM
yeah, it did not let me ssh into the emulated machine as root either.  So I logged in as thomas.   Then at the bash shell prompt I used su -l  to become root.
How far have you gotten Marty .. I think the rest of us have not even partitioned a drive for LFS yet
Marty11:38 AM
Hi; I have typed su-l and it says  -- command not found
Thomas Walker Lynch11:39 AM
I am not sharing right now, but I thought we solved that.   You might have been looking at Dimitris's share.
excuse me, ... that was the wrong point in the chat

Thomas Walker Lynch11:39 AM
su   and -l  are separate
-l is an option
Marty11:40 AM
Got it Yeah !

I have debian terminal on one side and I want lfs to be displayed on the other side of my display

Sections must be run inside of an environment.  So for example to
build libstdc++ from the gcc package:

> environment_book gcc s5_libstdc++

Framming will add timers and logging:

> environment_book frame package_scope gcc s5_libstdc++

'environment_book' tells framming to put the stdout and stderr into 'build.log' 
and put framing and stderr into 'frame.log'

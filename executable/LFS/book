# Control-C does not work to stop this script.  Not sure why.  Suggest running it in the background then kill the job,
# or using pstree -p, and then to be careful to kill the parent.  Good to check pstree -p so as to see if other builds
# are running, particularly if ther ehave been problems.

# In a prior version I ran environment_book_m2 on each inner build call. Here it is called only once on the outer
# book_m2 call instead.  This inner call approach has the advantage that it makes only one local build.log and
# frame.log; however it has the disadvantage that the sudo timer can run out between builds.  I believe that sudo also
# times out when no password is provided for a long time, so it can make quite a mess. With this outer call approach the
# sudo password is asked for only once.

# In m1, the frame log will show this call, but once in the environment_book_m2, the frames called in the book_m2
# script will be on m2.

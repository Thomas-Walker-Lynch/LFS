The scripts here are kind of documents rather than canned solutions.

Do not run these scripts without understanding them.

After editing I source the scripts rather than running them.  Perhaps when they get further along
they can be made executable.

Should define an environment variable for the install type, so that the scripts
can have if blocks rather than commented out blocks.

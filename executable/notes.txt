Need to make a script to grab the package and unpack it, and another to clean up the source directory to be run after
the source is installed.  This way we do them one at a time and have a fresh one every time.

Mod the chapter 6 script and others that look for the build directory and delete it. Instead we unpack fresh
each time, then make the build directory.

Need to check the md5 sums after the wget

I am using github.com/Thomas-Walker-Lynch/resources.  This includes the directory names 'executable library document' instead
of 'bin lib docs'  for the build (not for LFS!)

Divergences from the book:

  1. The initial user created with the Debian install (on the QEMU virtual machine)
  is already lfs.  We don't start out as root in the book.  Hence we do not need to add the lfs user and
  fix permissions in s4.3.  I am wondering if we will need a grand fix permissions at some point.

Scripts are in flux .. see notes in the scripts

still neeed to apply patches s3.3

Use gdisk.  gdisk is specified in the EFI manual.  Do not use fdisk.

sdx3 at 20G I did run out of disk space after saving some checkpoints and
storing upstream. The scripts no longer do checkpoints, and upstream has
been moved to the build stream, so 20G should be enough even when working
on the build for a long time.

Machines that hibernate write core memory to swap, so the swap partition must
be at least equal to the core size.  Swap is convnetionally set to
2x or 3x the amount of core.

For a real build sdx3 ended up being about 1T, as that is the size of the SSD

          > mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdx3
          > mkfs.vfat /dev/sdx2

Note Linux LUKS is a partition type.  Type command 'l' then search for
linux to see the linux partition types.

LFS Linux From Scratch
LFS Linux File System

This is an unfortunate collision because LFS is a partition type, 8300, and we use EFI and LFS
to distinguish between the EFI and LFS partitions.

I will change the namespace for environment variables to LUSTUCRU_.  That should not
collide with anything else.  .. a bit long used LUS_ instead.

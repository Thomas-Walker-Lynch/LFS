1. built to ramdisk, then copy to target device

2. A usb stick that would boot on just about any platform, and then characterize the
   hardware

   It could even return the kernel config tailored for that platform.  The config
   could then be included in the build directory and the construction of a system
   would run automatically. 

   The system booted by the usb stick need not have a monitor, but it does have one
   the user may be informed and asked questions about options.

   iso images for said usb stick could be included in the lib of the Lustucru distribution.
   that we know the configuration made by our hardware expert is compatible with our
   Lustucru distribution.

   Most all systems have usb these days, but such an iso could also be written to
   other media types.  Perhaps booted over the network.

   Perhaps a small expert system and a database of hardware knowledge could be included.

   It would be a separate hardware expert project.

3. too bad that shell aliases are not inherited into environments

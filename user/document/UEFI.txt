1. does the UEFI partition have to have a bootable flag?

    https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/620657/do-you-need-to-set-bootable-flag-when-installing-linux-in-uefi-mode

    "This flag is irrelevant when an UEFI partitioning scheme is used. You only need
    an "EFI system partition" to be able to boot successfully."

2.

In chapter 5 we install kernel headers. We do build nor configure the kernel for that, so that
is unrelated.

There appear to be three steps:
   1. build software builds used by grub and the kernel
   2. manually configure the kernel
   3. different grub configuration

The software used by grub and the kernel is compiled before the configuration stoppage.

The kernel config interrupts our otherwise beautiful automatic install.  Though this 
interruption comes very late in the process.  The user will only be forced to sit and
wait through the kernel build and the grub build after the configure step.

We do a menuconfig, that must run in a terminal. That is too bad as I had used
emacs to ssh into my emulator.  Well there is ecurses.  See kernel_config.txt

Do we really need to do the grub build after the kernel build? If it could be done before that
would be one less thing to have to watch.

All the action happens in chapter 10, c10.  Note we still must run c11 afterward. Seems like
c11 can be done before c10 and thus be automatic.  Probably make that change after I see this
go.

After experimenting ended up with this:

          sdx1 uefi 500M  (seems 100M would be more than enough)
          sdx2 swap 16G  (2 or 3 times system memory, or at least equal to it)
          sdx3 linux rest  at least 20G

Ran out of disk space due to saving checkpoints, but I stopped making those.  They
can also be stored on the build machine.

For a real build sdx3 ended up being about 1T, as that is the size of the SSD

          > mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdx3
          > mkfs.vfat /dev/sdx2

camel case, snake case

camel case can not exist for all caps variables, which is a convention going way back for
globals in C and unix

all caps for exported variables, all smalls for locals, snake case - prevents conflicts
with the environment inherited from the parent, as we never export lower case variable names.


$ returns value

no space before or after the equal when assigning a value

single quotes no variable expansion
double quotes has variable expansion

    > a=3
    > echo $a
    3

    > echo '$a' 
    $a

    > echo "$a" 
    3

quotes needed on variables for:
 1. embedded space characters
 2. variable is a place holder, such as in an argument list or -z test.


assignment may be done before calling a command and it affects the environment of the command
assignment has a return code of zero if no command follows

export to make available to children


-
helper scripts
sourced helper scripts
chained helper scripts


true and false are commands with error code returns
test return_code -eq value  ; gets to be tedious
or pipe with variable set to true or false

return code of script is the return code of the last command called in the script,
or the value of exit for executed scripts or the value of return for sourced scripts.  If when
in an interactive shell you source a script with exit, and it will exit your shell.

The command for unmount is umount.
A device may be mounted in multiple places, umount by mp affects the specified mp mount, umount
by device unmounts all.  

prefix of variable name may be interpreted as a namespace for a number of variables.  Do not use the prefix itself as a
variable name or grep and sed will never be able find or change it.

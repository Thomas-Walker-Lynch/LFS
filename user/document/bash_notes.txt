assignment may be done before calling a command and it affects the environment of the command

all caps for exported variables, all smalls for locals, snake case - prevents conflicts
with the environment inherited from the parent, as we never export lower case variable names.

sourced helper scripts
chained helper scripts


true and false are commands with error code returns
test return_code -eq value  ; gets to be tedious
or pipe with variable set to true or false

return code of script is the return code of the last command called in the script,
or the value of exit for executed scripts or the value of return for sourced scripts.  If when
in an interactive shell you source a script with exit, and it will exit your shell.

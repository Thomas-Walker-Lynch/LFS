     sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-clients libvirt-daemon-system bridge-utils virtinst libvirt-daemon virt-manager -y

2. directions for Debian suggested using kvm-ok to see if virtualization is allowed, but thtat does not
   work with Fedora.  The thing to do with Fedora was to install with the virtualization tag.  This stuff
   did not really help:

      think that kmv-ok looks for other things too, but we could check the processor flags: "vmx" for intel or "svm" for
      amd. Maybe something like this?  cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'vmx\|svm'

    It turned out to be difficult.  Some say the "AMD-V" processor flag.  Some say the "svm" flag.  I had a different flag
    "svm_lock" though many sites describe it, none actually said whether that meant kvm would work.  In the end I installed
    using the directions for Fedora, and ran the virt-manager.  That has an info tab that said kvm work working.

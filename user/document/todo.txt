     variable for installing docs, or a separate docs install

     debugging symbols included or not environment variable

     add a third log, has the frames and times like the frame log, but the content goes through grep
     and is filtered for error indicator tags .. perhaps grep -iE 'error|not found'

       LFS uses sysvinit is the alternative systemctl?  apparently there is also
       another alternative

       LFS user after the chroot picks up /etc/passwd has not lfs entry
       LFS_M2_FILESYSTEM needs to be a parameter somewhere, currently hard set in 'build'

       M2_FILESYSTEM is currently mounted at boot in fstab - we should manually set
       LFS_M2_FILESYSTEM variable and manually mount the target of the build device.

       currently in environment_book_m1-1:
       # shoud be parameters
       LFS_M2_FILESYSTEM="/mnt/m2_filesystem"
       MAKEFLAGS="-j12" 

       s7.06 add user and group lfs for the install

       need to get the correct wget options, perhaps better it does not create
       a spearate log file as the output already goes into a log

       wget is a confused program, it prints information to stderr.  Lets move to using
       curl.  Note
       https://serverfault.com/questions/70889/wget-to-print-errors-but-nothing-otherwise

         [wizard@laptop ~] curl -s -S http://www.google.coccm/ > /dev/null && echo "TRUE"
         curl: (6) Couldn't resolve host 'www.google.coccm'
         [wizard@laptop ~]$ curl -s -S http://www.google.com/ > /dev/null && echo "TRUE"
         TRUE

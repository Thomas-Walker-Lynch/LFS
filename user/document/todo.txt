     pull wipe out of build, have build first check that m2_filesystem is empty

     variable for installing docs, or a separate docs install

     debugging symbols included or not environment variable

     add a third log, has the frames and times like the frame log, but the content goes through grep
     and is filtered for error indicator tags .. perhaps grep -iE 'error|not found'

      mkdir package/application  package/patch  package/document
      nah,  instead upstream/package  upstream/patch upstream/document

      also log/build log/frame log/tell-tales

      single data stamped log file directory files build frame error in it

       LFS uses sysvinit is the alternative systemctl?  apparently there is also
       another alternative

2022-06-18T23:27:51Z

       LFS user after the chroot picks up /etc/passwd has not lfs entry
       LFS_M2_FILESYSTEM needs to be a parameter somewhere, currently hard set in 'build'

       M2_FILESYSTEM is currently mounted at boot in fstab - we should manually set
       LFS_M2_FILESYSTEM variable and manually mount the target of the build device.

2022-06-20T11:25:00Z
       currently in environment_book_m1-1:
       # shoud be parameters
       LFS_M2_FILESYSTEM="/mnt/m2_filesystem"
       MAKEFLAGS="-j12" 

       s7.06 add user and group lfs for the install

       need to get the correct wget options, perhaps better it does not create
       a spearate log file as the output already goes into a log
     
2022-06-22T21:49:48Z

       wget is a confused program, it prints information to stderr.  Lets move to using
       curl.  Note
       https://serverfault.com/questions/70889/wget-to-print-errors-but-nothing-otherwise

         [wizard@laptop ~] curl -s -S http://www.google.coccm/ > /dev/null && echo "TRUE"
         curl: (6) Couldn't resolve host 'www.google.coccm'
         [wizard@laptop ~]$ curl -s -S http://www.google.com/ > /dev/null && echo "TRUE"
         TRUE

      add env_configure that accepts the name of the target device, runs
      wipe, and accepts options.  env_configure  sets variable like MAKEFILE="j12"
      etc.

      Perl is unhappy not to find local variables in env_m2, must have printed this a 100 times:
        perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
          LANGUAGE = (unset),
          LC_ALL = (unset),
          LANG = "en_US.UTF-8"

      book_m1_to_m2 needs to be run after rebooting the virtual machine and continuing and m2 install,
      however it will give errors as the make devices will already be done.  Need to check this, perhaps
      split into two scripts and have env_m2 run one of those.  Root problem is that the repo needs
      to be mounted again if it is not mounted.  Other stuff too.  note the /etc/fstab file created
      in c10.

      need scripts to mount and unmount the stuff in m2 fstab

      initial file with variables set for such things as the target, whether to wipe the disk first, etc
      put in the build directory by the admin building linux, and if it is not there, it does not build.
      perhaps an example in the library dir

     env_incantatio should add itself to the [] in the prompt

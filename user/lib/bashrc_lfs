# bash insists that PS1 come from the bashrc file. --norc otherwise no init file, then no PS1. Problem is that I don't
# want to run ~/.bashrc when starting bash from within env --ignore-environment.  That defeats the whole purpose.
# Hence I have writen this bashrc_lfs file to be called from scripts.  The pull it directly fron the library directory.

export PS1="$PPS1"

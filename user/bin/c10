# s10.4 book proposes to make a rescue copy of the boot record.  This could save
# us if we have the wrong device in the configuration, perhaps the build machine's
# device. (But then where do we store it? Probably need a config variable for
# this) Or, if the target media is already bootable and we mess that up.  But this
# requires getting some software from BLF, so I will leave this for later.

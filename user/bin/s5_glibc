# ../lib from "$LUS_M2_FS_MP"/lib64 is the same as "$LUS_M2_FS_MP"/lib, however after we do a changeroot a symlink to an absolute location
# relative to the old root would be a bad thing.
#
# ../lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 currently does not exist.  It is ok to have a symlink to nowhere, but at some point there
# will have to be a library to find at that location.
#
# So there are two unsual things here.  First off we are not in source directory created by expanding the tar file, yet
# the book says that is where builds are supposed to start.  Secondly the source file does not exist (the link target).
# We assume it will exist in the future.

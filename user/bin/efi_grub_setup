# a great idea to protect the build system boot, we should do this.
# requires making a partition on a usb flash drive etc.

# section: Kernel Configuration for UEFI support
#   see efi_linux we build the kernel like this in the first place

# section: Find or Create the EFI System Partition
#   the partitioning stuff is alredy done way up front
#   the mount is part of the script m2fs_mount, so should already be mounted by now
#   mount efi variable fs also already done in m2fs_mount

# section: Setting Up the Configuration
#  rather redundant section title no?  isn't this also the chapter title?

# this puts files into /boot. This does not written the boot sector, which is
# good because we never told it which device we are targetting.

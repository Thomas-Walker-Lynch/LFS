Scripts for Building Linux From Scratch

Genesis is LFS11 stable, see: https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/downloads/stable/

Lustucru, the man who did amazing things, but did not get the recognition he deserved because of his name.
Though he did find true love, and isn't that what matters?

The LFS book contains a great deal of information on how to build the various packages that constitute Linux and the
order to do them in.  I went through the book with some assistance from some of the LFS people.  It was fun.  I typed
up these scripts while doing it.  Now that I have them, I am trying to figure out what to do with them next...

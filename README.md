Scripts for Building Linux From Scratch

Lustucru, the man who did amazing things yet did not receive the recognition he deserved, all because of his name.
However, he did find true love, and isn't that what matters? Just like Linux.

The genesis of these scripts is LFS11 stable, see: https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/downloads/stable/

The LFS book contains a great deal of information on how to build the various packages that constitute Linux and the
order they go in.  A small group of us met weekly to go through the book. Rather than typing into a shell, I typed into
the scripts, then ran them.  As the others pointed the LFS11 scripts are already on the website.  

These scripts handle the shell environment in a direct manner, integrate logging, and give execution time for
the various sections, chapters, and the whole big build.  A person may mix manual execution with script
execution.

So what to do with these scripts next?
